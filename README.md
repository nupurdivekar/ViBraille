# ViBraille


Overview of the System Workflow:
Image Capture: The camera takes a picture of the text.
OCR Processing: The image is processed by OCR software to extract the text.
Text to Braille Translation: The text is converted into Braille code.
Data Transfer: The Braille code is sent to the Arduino.
Vibration Output: The Arduino controls the motors to create Braille patterns.
Important Considerations:
Accuracy of OCR: The effectiveness of the system depends greatly on the accuracy of the OCR process. Good lighting and clear text are important.
Efficient Communication: The method of transferring data from the OCR system to the Arduino should be reliable and fast.
Intuitive Motor Layout: The arrangement of the vibration motors should be intuitive for the user, mimicking the layout of Braille characters.
This process combines hardware interaction, software processing, and tactile feedback to convert visual text into a format that can be 'read' through touch by Braille-literate users.
